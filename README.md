# Fan behavior
- `GPIO13` controls the fan output in [`src/io_handler.h`](/Users/baxrom/ish_full/dimlom_ishi/smartgreenhouse/IotAgroAi/src/io_handler.h).
- Manual fan control comes from `{id}/fan/control`, but it only works when AI mode is off through `{id}/mode/ai = 0`.
- In AI mode, fan turns on when temperature goes above `max_temperature`.
- In AI mode, fan turns off when temperature goes below `min_temperature`.
- If `MHZ19_ENABLED` is set to `1` and the CO2 sensor is working, fan also turns on above `max_air_co2` and turns off only after both temperature and CO2 drop below their `min_*` thresholds.

# 12V relay wiring
- Do not connect a 12V fan directly to ESP32 `GPIO13`.
- Use a relay module or MOSFET driver between ESP32 and the 12V fan supply.
- Typical relay wiring: `GPIO13 -> IN`, `ESP32 GND -> relay GND`, `relay VCC -> 5V or module-rated VCC`, `12V+ -> relay COM`, `relay NO -> fan +`, `fan - -> 12V-`.
- Keep the 12V fan power separate from the ESP32 GPIO. Grounds should be common only where the relay module/driver requires it.
- Many relay boards are active-low. If your relay turns on when `GPIO13` is LOW, set `FAN_ACTIVE_LOW` to `1` in [`src/io_handler.h`](/Users/baxrom/ish_full/dimlom_ishi/smartgreenhouse/IotAgroAi/src/io_handler.h).

# LED relay wiring
- The current build uses a plain LED through a relay on `GPIO26` (`LED_RELAY_PIN`).
- The MQTT/API device name stays `led`, so existing `{id}/led/control` commands still work.
- Many relay boards are active-low. If your LED relay turns on when `GPIO26` is HIGH, set `LED_RELAY_ACTIVE_LOW` to `0` in [`src/io_handler.h`](/Users/baxrom/ish_full/dimlom_ishi/smartgreenhouse/IotAgroAi/src/io_handler.h).
- The previous FastLED strip code is still present. Set `LED_DRIVER_RELAY` to `0` to use the old `STRIP_PIN`/`NUMLEDS` implementation.
